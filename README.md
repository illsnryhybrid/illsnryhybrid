- 👋 Hi, I’m @illsnryhybrid
- 👀 I’m interested in starting my coding journey. Right now I'm hyper focused on PowerShell for use in my job to "automate the boring stuff," but I'm also interested in Andriod app development and Python.
I started this coding journy learning to write simple scripts in BASH because I liked to "distro hop" often. I hated having to install the same software every time I made a jump, so I learned to automate it!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning  PowerShell so I can learn the same things I could do in BASH, but for Windows. My current job (I'm sure like many young sysadmins) uses Windows for everything so I have to get learning.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collarborate quite yet. Still a little unsure about my skills.
